 I'm Sharon Blackie and I'd like to welcome you to Mythlines, an exclusive podcast for the gold level of my membership program, this Mythic Life. In each of these podcasts, I'll read in one of my favourite myths or fairy tales and talk about its themes and its symbolism and its relevance to the issues we face in our lives in these ever more challenging times. Ash and Poodle by the brother's grin. The wife of a rich man fell sick and as she felt that her end was drawing near, she called her only daughter to her bedside and said, dear child, be good and pious and then the good god will always protect you and I will look down on you from heaven and be near you. Thereupon, she closed her eyes and departed. Every day the maiden went out to her mother's grave and wept and she remained pious and good. When winter came, the snow spread a white sheet over the grave and by the time the spring sun had drawn it off again, the man had taken another wife. The woman brought with her into the house two daughters, who were beautiful and fair of face but vile and black of heart. Now began a bad time for the poor step-child. Is this stupid goose to sit in the parlor with us? They said, he who wants to eat bread must earn it out with a kitchen wench. They took her pretty clothes away from her, put an old grey bed gown on her and gave her wooden shoes. Just look at the proud princess how decked out she is, they cried and laughed and let her into the kitchen. There she had to do hard work from morning to night, get up before daybreak, carry water, light fires, cook and wash. Besides this the sisters did her every imaginable injury. They mocked her and emptied her peas and lentils into the ashes so that she was forced to sit and pick them out again. In the evening, when she had worked till she was weary, she had no bed to go to but had to sleep by the hearth in the cinders. And as on that account she always looked dusty and dirty, they called her Cinderella. It happened that the father was once going to the fair and he asked his two step-daughters what he should bring back for them. Beautiful dresses, said one. pearls and jewels, said the second. And you, Cinderella, said he, what will you have? Father, break off for me the first branch which knocks against your hat on the way home. So he bought beautiful dresses, pearls and jewels for his two step-daughters, and on his way home as he was riding through a green ticket, a hazel twig brushed against him and knocked off his hat. Then he broke off the branch and took it with him. When he reached home he gave his step-daughters the things which they had wished for, and to Cinderella he gave the branch from the hazel bush. Cinderella thanked him. She went to her mother's grave and planted the branch on it, and wept so much that the tears fell down on it and watered it, and it grew and became a handsome tree. Three times a day Cinderella went and sat beneath it, and wept and prayed, and a little white bird always flew onto the tree, and if Cinderella expressed a wish, the bird threw down to her exactly what she had wished for. And so it happened then that the king gave orders for a festival which was to last three days, and to which all the beautiful young girls in the country were invited, in order that his son might choose himself a bride. When the two stepsisters heard that they too were to appear among the number, they were delighted. The called Cinderella and said, comb our hair for us, brush our shoes and fasten our buckles, for we are going to the wedding of the king's palace. Cinderella obeyed but wept, because she too would have liked to go with them to the dance, and she begged her stepmother to allow her to do so. You go, Cinderella," said she, covered in dust and dirt as you are, and would go to the festival. You have no shoes and no clothes and yet you would dance. But as Cinderella went on asking the stepmother said at last, I have emptied a dish of lentils into the ashes for you. If you have picked them out again in two hours, then you shall go with us. The maiden went through the back door into the garden and called, you tame pigeons, you turtledoves, and all you birds beneath the sky, come and help me to pick the good into the pot, the bad into the crop. Then two white pigeons came in by the kitchen window, and afterwards the turtledoves, and at last all the birds beneath the sky came worrying and crowding in and alighted amongst the ashes, and the pigeons nodded with their heads and began pick, pick, pick, pick, and the rest also began pick, pick, pick, pick and gathered all the good grains into the dish. Hardly had one hour passed before they had finished, and then they all flew out again. So the girl took the dish to her stepmother and was glad, and she believed that now she would be allowed to go with them to the festival. But the stepmother said, no Cinderella, you have no clothes, and you cannot dance, you would only be laughed at. And a Cinderella wept at this, the stepmother said, if you can pick two dishes of lentils out of the ashes for me in one hour, you shall go with us. And she thought to herself that she most certainly cannot do again. When the stepmother had emptied the two dishes of lentils among the ashes, the maiden went through the back door into the garden and cried, new tame pigeons, you turtle doves, and all your birds beneath the sky come and help me to pick the good into the pot to bat into the crop. Then two white pigeons came in by the kitchen window, and afterwards the turtle doves, and at a length all the birds beneath the sky came worrying and crowding in and alighted amongst the ashes, and the doves nodded with their heads and began pick, pick, pick, pick and the others began also pick, pick, pick and they gathered all the good seeds into the dishes, and before half an hour was over they had already finished, and they all flew out again. Then the maiden was delighted, and believed that she might now go with them to the wedding. But the stepmother said, all this will not help, you cannot go with us for you have no clothes and cannot dance, we should be ashamed of you. At this she turned her back on Cinderella, and hurried away with her two proud daughters. As no one was now at home, Cinderella went to her mother's grave beneath the hazel tree, and cried, shiver and quiver little tree, silver and gold throw down over me. Then the bird threw a gold and silver dress down to her, and slippers embroidered with silk and silver. She put on the dress with all speed and went to the wedding. Her step sisters and the stepmother, however, did not know her, and thought she must be a foreign princess that she looked so beautiful in the golden dress. They never once thought of Cinderella, and believed that she was sitting at home in the dirt, picking lentils out of the ashes. The prince approached her, took her by the hand, and danced with her. She would dance with no other maiden, and never let loose of her hand, and if anyone else came to invite her, he said, this is my partner. She danced till it was evening, and then she wanted to go home. But the king's son said, I will go with you and be you company, for he wished to see to whom the beautiful maiden belonged. She escaped from him, however, and sprang into the pigeon house. The king's son waited until her father came, and then he told him that the unknown maiden had leapt into the pigeon house. The old man thought, could it be Cinderella? And they had to bring him an axe and a pickaxe so that he might hue the pigeon house to pieces, but no one was inside it. And when they got home, Cinderella lay in her dirty clothes among the ashes, and a dim little oil lamp was burning on the mantelpiece. Cinderella had jumped quickly down from the back of the pigeon house, and had run to the little hazel tree, and there she had taken off her beautiful clothes and laid them on the grave, and the bird had taken them away again. And then she had seated herself in the kitchen amongst the ashes in her usual grey gown. Next day when the festival began afresh and her parents and stepsisters had gone once again, Cinderella went to the hazel tree and said, Shiva and quiver my little tree, silver and gold, throw down over me. Then the bird threw down an even more beautiful dress than on the preceding day. And when Cinderella appeared at the wedding in this dress, everyone was astonished by her beauty. The king's son had waited until she came, and he instantly took her by the hand and danced with no one but her. When others came and invited her, he said, this is my partner. When evening came she wished to leave, and the king's son followed her and wanted to see into which house she went, but she sprang away from him and into the garden behind the house. There instead a beautiful tall tree on which hung the most magnificent pairs. She clambered up so nimbly between the branches like a squirrel that the king's son did not know where she was gone. He waited until her father came and said to him, the unknown maiden has escaped from me and I believe she has climbed up the pear tree. The father thought, could it be Cinderella? And he had an export and cut the tree down, but no one was on it. And when they got into the kitchen, Cinderella lay there among the ashes as usual for she had jumped down on the other side of the tree, had taken the beautiful dress to the bird on the little hazel tree, and had put on her usual grey gown. On the third day when the parents and sisters had gone away, Cinderella went once more to her mother's grave and said to the little tree, she fed and quiver my little tree, silver and gold throw down over me. And now the bird threw down to her address which was even more splendid and magnificent than any she had yet had, and the slippers were golden. And when she went to the festival in the dress, no one knew how to speak for astonishment. The king's son danced with her only, and if anyone invited her to dance, he said, this is my partner. When evening came, Cinderella wished a game to leave, and the king's son was anxious a game to go with her, but she escaped from him so quickly that he could not follow her. The king's son, however, had employed a rose, and had caused the whole staircase to be smeared with pitch, and there, when she ran down, had the maidens left slipper remained stuck. The king's son picked it up, and it was small and dainty and all golden. Next morning, he went with a slipper to his father and said to him, no one shall be my wife, but she who's fought this golden slipper fits. Then the two sisters were glad for they had pretty feet. The eldest went with a shoe into her room and wanted to try it on, and her mother stood by, but she could not get her big toe into it, and the shoe was too small for her. Then her mother gave her a knife and said, cut the toe off. When you are queen, you will have no more needs to go in foot. So the maiden cut her toe off, forced her foot into the shoe, swallowed down the pain, and went out to the king's son. Then he took her on his horse as his bride and rode away with her. They were obliged, however, to pass the grave, and there on the hazel tree sat two pigeons who cried, turn and peep, turn and peep, there's blood within the shoe. The shoe it is too small for her, the true bride waits for you. Then the prince looked at her foot and saw how the blood was trickling from it. He turned his horse around and took the false bride home again, and said she was not the true one, and that the other sister was to put the shoe on. So then this one went into her chamber and got her toes safely into the shoe, but her heel was too large. So her mother gave her a knife and said, cut a bit off your heel, when you are queen, you will have no more need to go on foot. So the maiden cut a bit off her heel, forced her foot into the shoe, swallowed the pain, and went out to the king's son. He took her up on his horse as his bride and rode away with her, but when they passed by the hazel tree, the two pigeons sat on it and cried, turn and peep, turn and peep, as blood within the shoe, the shoe it is too small for her, the true bride waits for you. He looked down at her foot and saw how the blood was running out of her shoe and how it had stained her white stocking quite red. Then he turned his horse and took the false bride home again. This also is not the right one, he said. Have you no other daughter? No, said the man. There is still a little stunted kitchen-wench which my late wife left behind her, but she cannot possibly be the bride. The king's son said he was to send her up to him, but the mother answered, oh no, she has much too dirty, she cannot show herself. But he absolutely insisted on it, and Cinderella had to be called. She first washed her hands and face clean, and then went and bowed down before the king's son, who gave her the golden slipper. Then she seated herself on a stool, drew her foot out of the heavy wooden shoe she wore, and put it into the slipper, which fitted like a glove. And when she rose up and the king's son looked at her face, he recognized the beautiful maiden who had danced with him, and he cried, that is the true bride. The stepmother and the two sisters were horrified and became pale with rage, but he took Cinderella up on his horse and rode away with her. And as they passed by the hazel tree, the two white doves cried, turn and peep, turn and peep, no blood is in the shoe, the shoe is not too small for her, the true bride rides with you. And when they had cried that, the two came flying down and placed themselves on Cinderella's shoulders, one on the right, the other on the left, and they remained sitting there. When the wedding with a king's son was to be celebrated, the two false sisters came and wanted to get into favour with Cinderella and share her good fortune. But when the betrothed couple went to church, the elder was at her right side, and the younger was at the left, and the pigeons came, and pecked out one eye from each of them. Afterwards as they came back, the elder was at the left and the younger at the right, and then the pigeons pecked out the other eye from each, and thus, for their wickedness and falsehood, they were punished with blindness all their days. So the story of Ash and Poodle by the brother's grim is, of course, one of the versions of the stories we now would think of as Cinderella tales, and folklorists generally hold that Cinderella tales are the most widely known folktales of all, so to date more than 700 different versions of the story of Cinderella have been collected from all around the world pretty much every continent. And in all of these stories, the protagonist is a young woman who is living in some kind of reduced circumstances, and as the story progresses and eventually ends, those circumstances are suddenly changed to remarkably good fortune. The story of Roedopis, or Rosie cheeks, which was told by the Greek geographer Strabo sometime between around the 7th century BC and AD 23, is usually considered to be the earliest known variant of the Cinderella story that was actually written down, and it's about a Greek slave girl who marries the king of Egypt, an eagle snatched one of her sandals from her maid while she was out walking and carried it to Memphis, and while the king king was administering justice out in the open air in Egypt, in Memphis, the eagle, when it arrived above his head flung the young slave girl's sandal into his lap, and the king was stirred both by the beautiful shape of the sandal and by the strangeness of the occurrence, particularly undoubtedly the symbolism of the eagle, and he sent men in all directions out into the country in search of the woman whose sandal it was, and when she was found in the city of Nokratis, she was brought up to Memphis and became the wife of the king, so again there we have a shoe, some type of shoe, and we have a slave girl who then rises to the position of Queen of Egypt. And the Chinese story of Yazian, which is first referred to in a source from around A.D. 860, is another early variant of the Cinderella tale, and in this version, Yae Xen is the daughter of the local tribal leader who died when she was young, a father died rather than in many of the stories where the father is still alive, but her mother died before her father, and so she is left under the care of her father's second wife who abused her as in many of the later versions of the Cinderella stories that we've come to know we'd love so well. So Yae Xen, befriends a fish, which is the reincarnation of the deceased mother, and we'll find that concept we found it in an ashen puddle, we'll find it as we go on to, to think about the motifs in this story, this idea of the deceased mother in some way coming back to life, living on, being reincarnated, but in this case, the mother is reincarnated specifically as a fish, her stepmother and her step sister or her half sister, I think it was in this case killed a fish, but Yae Xen finds the bones, the bones are magical, and they advise her and help her dress appropriately for a local festival, including the wearing of a very light golden shoe, so again, we have the shoe. Her step family, though, recognizes her at the festival and causes her to flee and accidentally lose the shoe, afterwards the king of a different sea island obtains the shoe and is curious about it because no one on his island has any feet that can fit it. So he searches everywhere, finally reaches Yae's house where she tries on the shoe, the king realizes she's the one he's been looking for and takes her back to his kingdom. And her cruel stepmother and half-sister are killed by flying fish, which seems very satisfying into that particular story. Now if we come back to Europe and to European versions of the Cinderella tale, the first literary version of the story was published in Italy by Jean-Battista Basile in his Pentameroenae in 1634. In this story, a prince has a daughter called Zazola, who is tended by a beloved governess, and the governess with Zazola's help persuades the prince to marry her. The governess, though, then brings forward six daughters of her own, who abuse Zazola and send her into the kitchen to work as a servant. The prince, Zazola's father, this is, goes to the island of Cinea, meets a fairy who gives presence to his daughter, and brings back for her a golden spade, a golden bucket, a silk and napkin, and a date seedling. The girl cultivates the tree, and when the king of her place hosts a ball, Zazola appears at the ball dressed very richly by a fairy who lives in the date tree. The king falls in love with her, but Zazola runs away before he can find out who she is, as happens in almost all of these European stories. Twice she escapes the king and his servants, the third time the king's servant captures one of her slippers, and the king invites all of the maidens in the land to a ball with a shoe test. He identifies Zazola after the shoe jumps from his hand to her foot, and eventually he marries her. So we have many of the themes in what we think of as the archetypical Cinderella story in this early version in Italy. The version, though, that's now most widely known in the English-speaking world, was published in French by Charles Perro, in Istoir, Ooh, Kant du Tompasse, in 1697. And it's kind of similar to the Graham's story, which I read except for a few things which differ and which are quite significant. The main difference is that here, for the first time is, there's a fairy in the Basile story from Italy, but here there is a very godmother, rather than the mother's grave, the hazel tree, and the birds. The fairy godmother magically appears, kind of out of nowhere, and immediately begins to transform Cinderella from basically a house servant to a beautifully dressed young lady such as she was by birth, all in the effort to get Cinderella to a ball. So the Perro's story, which was the one on which the famous Disney movie was based, the fairy godmother turns a pumpkin into a golden carriage, mice into horses, a rat into a coachman, and lizards into footmen, then she turns Cinderella's rags into a beautiful george gown, complete with a delicate pair of glass slippers. So the glass slipper is unique to Perro's version, in most cases there, particularly beautifully shaped small, sometimes golden or jeweled sandals or shoes, but the glass slipper was kind of invented by Perro, and the derivatives of Perro's story. Other tellings from other parts of the world, it's actually not a slipper, but an inklet or a ring or a bracelet that gives the key, the prince the key to the Cinderella equivalence identity, but in Europe we're firmly and generally speaking firmly in the land of the footwear. In the story also the Perro's story, there is very much of an emphasis at the end on forgiveness, so Cinderella's step family in this story pleads for forgiveness and Cinderella agrees. Now taking away the helpful animal or tree that we see in many of the old stories and that we see rise again in the Grimm's story, which I read out in which I'll talk about in a minute, also takes away some of Cinderella's agency as a protagonist. So in the old stories she's really quite clever and really has quite a strong ability to help herself in the Perro version in France in a very, very courtly setting, that agency has taken from her and given to the fairy godmother, so really Cinderella doesn't do anything very much. It's all done on her behalf by the fairy godmother, so in the stories with a fairy godmother, Cinderella is rather a reduced kind of character, she doesn't have to use her new initiative, she's left with very little kind of mental work to do, other than to remember to meet the deadline and post on how late she must go home after the ball. In the earlier stories and later on over the Grimm's tradition, she faces many more challenges to overcome such as how to sort lentils or how to be dressed in the first place, how is she going to get the gown with which she may go to the ball, and generally she manages the dressing bit with the help of the animal that she has taken care of or the tree that she has paid attention to. This focus on the fairy godmother, although there is a mother in a godmother, nevertheless cuts out that strong maternal power which is passed on to the daughter in many of these earlier stories of the Cinderella type. So the version that I read just now, Ash and Poodle, was later published after Pearl by the brother's Grimm in their folktow collection, Grimm's Fairy Tales, in 1812. And then, as they came out with updated editions of their fairy tales, they changed the story a little by little, we'll come to that in a moment. But, their version from the very beginning is really much more intense than Pearl's version, in that Cinderella's father doesn't die, and he's a fairly ambiguous character as well discover, and also the stepsisters rather unpleasantly mutilate their feet to fit into the golden slipper. Here there is no fairy godmother, the Grimm's cut that out, it wasn't in there or all tradition, they say, but instead, help comes from a hazel tree that the heroine has obtained from her father, but planted on her mother's grave. Now, in the second edition of the collection, which was in 1899, the Grimm's supplement of the original 1812 version with a coda in which the stepsisters suffer a terrible punishment for their cruelty, they are blinded, and this is the first time that the Grimm's put this in, which is really interesting that they would have added that in afterwards. Now, in her book, here's an interesting thing about the Grimm's stories. In her book, Grimm's Bad Girls and Bold Boys, folklorist Ruth Botticheimer, tracks the speech across the Grimm's various editions of Ash and Poodle, and she looks at which characters are allowed to talk out loud, in other words, to engage in direct speech, and which characters just have their sentences summarized instead, so it's indirect or reported speech. And what she finds when she does this is a consistent pattern. Direct speech has tended over the course of the different version she says to be transferred from women to men, and from good to bad girls and women. So in other words, as the Grimm's continued to edit the story, the Good Woman, Cinderella and her dead mother, start talking directly less and less, and the men and the bad women, the step-other and the stepsisters, start talking directly more and more, so that she reports in the Grimm's 1812, first version of the story, Cinderella has 12 lines of direct speech as step-mother-four in the prints-four, but by 1857, in the last version of the story, Cinderella is down from 12 lines to just six lines of direct speech. And where she protests her poor treatment in 1812, she obeys unquestionably in 1864 when doesn't even comment on the way in which her step-other and step-sisters are now treating her. Where she lies to her step-other in 1812, again, she's completely silent by 1864. Her step-mother meanwhile is up to 12 lines of direct speech instead of four by 1864, and the prints has 11. So roof-boughting, body-timer argues that for the Grimm's, silence is both gendered and moral. So, good women illustrate their virtue through their silence and their passivity. Bad women show their badness by talking, which is un-womanly and tense of course, wicked. Men who are strong and active should speak at will, so now, in these later versions of the story, Cinderella wins because of her moral virtue, rather than her cleverness, and part of the way that we can see that she's virtuous is that she is silent. So, the story, many, many different iterations, many, many different things that shift from place to place, cut to culture, century to century. The zipes, well-known American folklorist, has argued that earlier versions of the Cinderella story, which in the oral tradition, are believed to date all the way back to the Ice Age, reflect a matrilineal society. So, another folklorist, August Nitchka, investigated the oldest version of the tale to make this point. He said that, in the oldest version, the hero is a young woman who receives help and gifts both from her dead mother, who lives on as a tree, and from animals. So, this very, very old story, he says, reflects a hunting and grazing society in which women were at the center, honored as the nurturing element. And let's face it, there is no nurturing element in the wicked stepmother of later tales. So, Jack Sykes concludes that today, I quote, instead of doing homage to women, we have a tale which is an insult to women. So, the stepmother is shown as wicked, but not the father. Cinderella herself is industrious, beautiful, virginal, passive, silent, girls quarrel over a man, princes, of course, a handsome marriage is the goal of life, and it is important to marry a rich man. And so, Zipes argues that this switch in this story, as we travel through time, reinforces increasingly sexist values, and also a Puritan ethos. Now, the Arne Thompson classification system of folklore, which we've encountered quite a bit before in these podcasts, classifies the Cinderella type tale as tale type 510, which and that tale type involves a persecuted heroine, magical help, meeting a prince, required proof of the heroine's identity, and marrying the prince. And there are many, many different motifs in these stories, and we're just going to concentrate on the later European ones now as we go through a couple of these characters under motifs. So here are some of the motifs that we could stepmother, common, folktale motif, the treacherous step-sisters, the initially unpromising heroine, the half as home, the assistance of a dead mother, in this case, usually her reincarnation in the form of the plant on the grave, animal helpers, clothes, beautiful clothes, which appear by magic in some way, the slipper test or the shoe test to see who's capable of wearing the shoe, the glass slipper, and the motif in which the lowly heroine marries the prince, so all of these very common folktale motifs are gathered together here in this particular collection as tale type 510 Cinderella Tales. So let's just look at some of the characters' remohment. First of all, the father. Now Cinderella's relationship with her father in the grim version is ambiguous. Pojo's version is less so because he states that the father who is largely absent in his story is completely dominated by his second wife, so whether you think that's reasonable or not, at least it explains why he doesn't prevent the abuse of his daughter. But in the grim version, the father plays quite an active role in several scenes, and it's not explained in the story why it is that he tolerates in this mistreatment of his child by his second family. And in many ways, you could argue that he himself participates in that mistreatment. He doesn't bring Cinderella anything beautiful from his trip away, even though she's asked for a twig or a branch that that knocks his hat, he could have brought her something else as well. He cuts down the tree and smashes the pigeon house, which could seem like fairly violent acts when the prince is looking for her after she's fled from the ball. He also describes Cinderella as a basically a kitchen mate who was left behind by his first wife. He does not own her as his daughter. And yet it's interesting that when he is told about the woman who has escaped from the ball that the prince fell in love with, who fled, the first thing he says is I wonder if this is Cinderella. So he sees something in her. He knows there is something about her. Is this something that he fears? And this is why he condones, oh, has condoned her mistreatment all this time? It's also interesting. And there's no sense of Cinderella being disobedient or disloyal to her father, but it's interesting that what she asks him for is a branch which effectively knocks his hat off. Is that Cinderella knocking the hat off the patriarchy? Or is it just something very much simpler than that? We will never know of course, but it's interesting to speculate. Then we have the mother, her actual mother, who is the archetypical, of course, good mother. The mother who helps her child, even when she is dead and who either reincarnates as we saw in some of the earlier versions of this story and other places around the world, or who finds a way of passing on her advice magically through an object. So in this story, the object is the tree, which, interestingly again, is given by her father, but the tree which grows on her mother's grave and somehow seems to imbue some of the life force of her mother. We saw this, if you recall, in one of our earliest stories, and the story of Vaselisa and Babi Yaga, in which Vaselisa's mother, before she died, gave her a magic doll. And this doll advised her when she needed it, when she was in the throes of her adventure with Babi Yaga. So again, the doll kind of channeling the mother's advice in the way that she might have given if she were actually alive. So this sense of eternal motherly love of the maternal persistence in a good way into the daughter's life that although she's dead, she hasn't really lost that love and that care is quite a common motif in folk tales and is particularly important in these versions of Cinderella. In contrast, we find the archetypical bad mother, kind of like the shadow side of the good mother, if you like, in the character of the wicked stepmother. And wicked stepmothers are incredibly common, particularly, I haven't really looked at them in other parts of the world, but particularly in European folk tales, as we carry on into modern times. And of course, this would have been not an unusual idea. The stepmother was a very common feature of many family lives because it was quite common for women to die in childbirth while they were still young and for the father then to take on another wife. And of course, the other wife would sometimes bring with her a family. And there would have been a competition for not just for affection of the father, but for limited resources, even in even in households that presented his middle class or having enough money, there would never the last have been competition for resources. These young women didn't go out and get jobs. They had to marry, well, in order to keep their mother, for example, in the style to which she would like to become accustomed. So this would not have been all that unusual a situation, this sense of the original daughter from the first family, from the first mother, being in some way superseded or not loved by the second family, the mother and the sisters. Now, clearly the tale of Cinderella takes this to extremes, but socially it would have reflected a real kind of situation. So the idea of the wicked stepmother, it's generally believed derives from that very real social situation and probable real life competition. So most of the versions of the Cinderella story feature a wicked stepmother, if it's not specifically a stepmother, then they define, they are defined by some kind of female persecutor, whoever it might be. Now, we also have another sort of maternal figure in some of the versions of this story, the fairy godmother. And again, as I mentioned, this is introduced in the European stories by Jean Perot, and it takes away the power of the original mother that sense of some kind of life force, some energy of the original mother persisting, either in bones or in reincarnations, or in some ways, bringing up through a bush planted on her grave, and it takes it away from the original mother, but nevertheless, there's still some kind of motherly element here. So there is always a residue of female power, which it's been argued would have come down from the very earliest version of this story in societies and the Ice Age, which would have been more matrilineal, but we do see that increasingly depleted over time. Cinderella's identity and her need to prove her identity, who she is, who she was, who she will become, is a critically important part of this story. It is quite a common folktale motif that the heroine cannot be won by the prince, or arguably cannot win the prince, depending on your until she's recognized by him in her true state, until he knows who she really is, so she appears to him in these stories as some image of beauty, the unknown, no idea who she is or where she comes from, she is a beautiful mystery, but he can't marry her, she can't marry him until he knows who she is. And in this particular type of story, until he knows that her true state is actually a degraded state, until he finds her mucky and covered in ashes from the hearth and marries her anyway. So that sense of knowing of the prince knowing the feminine, the masculine, knowing the feminine, discovering it, seeing it for what it is, and accepting it is a very important part of this story. He has to work, the prince has to work, at uncovering her true identity that's coming to know her. So Cinderella herself needs older stories and in the Grimm's story, which is more a reflection of the older stories and the kind of diversion that was taken by Pearl and others is not the passive girl that we often think of as Cinderella, not the cutesy rather insipud, Disney version of Cinderella. Instead, she's really quite shrewd, she's very practical, she's tough, she doesn't wait to be rescued by a fairy godmother or anybody else. She outwits her step family, she outwits her father, she even outwits the prince. She does her own magic, if we think back to the Grimm's version. There are a couple of verse spells which she recites to conjure up the birds in the tree and to get her clothes. She can command the birds. This is a serious young woman. She seems to get this power, again from her mother. It's passed down from mother to daughter. Her mother transmits it from the hazel tree on her grave. So really the Cinderella of our oldest lineage is a young woman to be really quite proud of whereas in the contemporary notion of Cinderella which would be signified by the Disney movies as always, they have seized upon the most insipud kind of story that they can. They have a hankering for a pair of fairy tales in particular in the Disney and studios. They choose these versions with very passive, nice, well brought up young woman who doesn't challenge, who doesn't speak back, who doesn't dream of taking her life into her own hands. But this is not how the original stories were. An American writer, Jane Yolen, who I'm sure many of you will know is written, rewritten many fairy tales and poems based on fairy tales, says this. To make Cinderella less than she is then is a heresy of the worst kind. It cheapens our most cherished dreams and it makes a mockery of the true magic inside all of us. The ability to change our own lives, the ability to control our own destinies. And this is what the early Cinderella has in spades. Now, just a couple of other little things before we finish the tree, the tree which is magical. It's a very common motif in European folk tales as we will have come across before. The Grims were particularly, as a fond of collecting stories about magical trees, maybe that's what they found when they went out into their oral culture. Clearly, Germany is a heavily forested land and it was at that time and it's not surprising that this would happen. But think of the Juniper tree and other stories where bones are buried between underneath trees and the tree is able to speak, for example, as a result in this concept of trees carrying the life force of the people, the dead people who are planted and beneath them is a really interesting and very beautiful common motif in European folklore. The hearth is another one. So the hearth is the center of the home. It seems downgraded when we see Cinderella banished to it, but really in an imaginal way, in a symbolic way, the hearth has always been the heart and the source of domestic magic. So if we think of Hestia, the Greek goddess of the hearth, she you would honor Hestia at your the source of domestic magic in your home. So the idea that Cinderella was banished to the hearth, yes, in a sense clearly from the social perspective, it is a downgrading. She doesn't get sleep in a comfortable bed. She gets to sleep in a bed of ashes. But symbolically, it represents her power who she is her identity at the heart of the home. And ashes, which may seem to be a little bit grubby, of course, were very much a symbol of purification and also of transformation in some societies, an initiate who was going on an initiatory experience, would have his face and his limbs smeared with ashes before going off. So is that there is a sense of purification, of protection, of the possibility of transformation, which is carried in being coated with ashes. And there is an element of this too in the Cinderella story. So whereas again, in the Disney version, in the most recent versions, it seems to be that that association with ashes and the home are terrible, dirty, exactly what she needs to escape from. Nevertheless, there is a power in half and in the ashes that is being reflected here in the Cinderella character. So when we look at how the story has developed and we've gone all the way in this brief discussion from the Ice Age up to the brother's grim, but it didn't stop there. We define that it didn't stop there. And over the past few decades, particularly, Cinderella has been repackaged over and over again. There are too many retellings to mention. Mostly, not surprisingly, the story has been repackaged and she has been repackaged to something of a feminist icon. But poetry, novels, short stories, the one that pops to my mind, most notably is Emma Donoghue's story and her wonderful book of fairy to retellings, kissing the witch. If you've never read that, I wholeheartedly recommend it, in which Donoghue has Cinderella in the end, finding the Prince really quite tedious and running off with a fairy godmother. It's very satisfying ending. But there's one very recent one that I especially like as well. So in 2019, Rebecca Solnet, the well-known environmental and feminist writer who coined the term mansplaining, she published a children's picture book which was entitled Cillerat Cinderella Liberator. And it ends with Cinderella opening her own bakery and forming a lasting platonic friendship with the prince who gives up his title to become a farmer. And that is the way that fairy stories change all through the ages. I hope you've enjoyed this particular one.
